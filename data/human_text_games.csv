2,Female,25,"I am a student in the Technion, in my free time I like running swimming playing tennis I also like to cook to my family and friends.

I really like my studies and it interests me very much.

While studying I work in a student position in one of the big corporates which is quite good for me.

I am planning to take a big vacation in the summer with my boyfriend and celebrate the end of the first year of studies.

I am also planning to continue to B.Sc. and I hope that I would like the research idea.

When I started learning I didn't suppose I would like it so much but I guess the part of it is that I figured out I am not that bad at it.

In the army I was a CAD developer and I really like that job.

All my friends that served with me in the army learned mechanical Engineering. When finishing the service in the army.

But although it was very interesting I figured out that the best option for me is to learn some degree that involves math and also talking to people and that's why I learned IE.

I hope I will found out that my choices in that period in life will be good and I think that they are.

In 10 years from now I see myself working as a investigator in some office.",The Left box,Speed!,Door C
3,Male,21,"One of my main passions in life is travelling. I try to travel as often as possible and for how long as possible. My method of action involves flying with low cost airlines (namely Wizz-air) and staying in hostel, which is basically the cheapest accommodation available. My top three favorite activities during my trips abroad is walking around the city and admiring the architecture, socializing with other people in the hostel and visiting various parks and nature reserves.



In the span of a year and a half, I managed to visit most of Europe and spent almost third of my time abroad. Of course paying for all of those trips isn't easy at all, however cheap they may be. I spend on average 15000 NIS a year on travelling, most of this sum comes from various scholarships I get from the Technion, some just involves getting good grades and others may involve voluntary work, but it pays the bills so I can't complain.



Unfortunately, I may have to put this hobby behind for the time being. As I'm currently searching for a job (a part time one, but nonetheless), and I probably wouldn't be able to take much time off, let alone depart on two months trips abroad. However, a real salary would hopefully allow me to pursue other interests besides travelling, and when I'll finally have enough time for travelling, I'll have the funds as well!",The Left box,Speed!,Door B

Unfortunately, the snake grows two additional heads, and each time I try to cut it's heads off the number of heads grow exponentially. 

In the end the room can not handle the huge snake and it bites us and then I wake up each time terrified covered in cold sweat. 

It really freaks me out because I hate reptiles, and it disgusts me even in my nightmares. 

I have this dream ever since I am 8 years old and started to sleep alone in my room, not able to fall asleep afterwards afraid that this snake will come and get me for real each time.

Not certain if I will be understood, but I will try; 

I have lived in a Kibbutz my whole life. I always enjoyed it.

Growing up in a sharing community and always being around kids my age. volunteer when ever you can, be nice, be fair. 

Now I study in the Technion, but I am almost the only one from my Kibbutz who went to university. 

Now I think my Kibbutz is a bubble. No motivation, nor aspiration to success. My whole life I felt lucky living where I have lived. Not anymore.

Here, in the Technion I realized I have no advantage, and probably I will have to struggle more than my fellow city students. For them It is normal to study in university, while in my place every one stares and thinks its odd that I am not going away to travel for a couple of years. 

(for example, is school, children how have done home-word where never popular)  

Nevertheless, I won't stop, hopefully I will finish my degree and start a different life, in which achievements and goals will have a great deal in them.

9,Male,19,"At the age of 4, I started practicing Wushu, more known as Kung-Fu.

Soon enough I reached the national team, training more and more and flying to more international championships. When I was 10, my coach (who actually saw a lot of potential in me, and liked me) decided to take me to the world championships. I trained really hard, twice a day - each time for 3 hours, 6 or 7 days a week, and everything was going really well. Unfortunately, about a month before the championships, I was hospitalized since I had some infection in my leg. I spent 3 days at the hospital, obviously without training, and therefore was extremely close to missing the competition. Luckily, I  was able to restore my skills and flew to Shaolin Temple in China, where the competition was held. Eventually I won 2 gold medals, and became a world champion at the age of 10 (My coach wasn't very pleased though). Anyway, he later gave me some sort of extremely important papers which I lost.

10,Male,24,"When I was 19 years old I decided to study philosophy. I had a huge number of questions about the universe, the truth knowledge, the science, the moral, etc., and I was anxious to know their answers. I began studying in university. First I studied historical subjects, like ""History of ancient philosophy"" or general topics as ""Methodologies in scientific investigation"".  The questions I had kept without answer. Many of them became nonsense. So the first thing I learned was to formulate meaningful questions.

Then I studied particular subjects as ""Logics"", ""Metaphysics"" and ""Epistemology"". These subjects opened my eyes to hundred of new questions. 

It was at that time when I first heard about ""quantum physics"". I remember when in one of the first lessons of ""Metaphysics"", during an open discussion between a student and the teacher, the second told him:

""That statement you've said contradicts the whole theory of quantum mechanics that the today's scientific community believes in it"".

The student asked why?

""To understand that you will have to study a physics degree first, thought it is a extremely complicated field"".

Choosing a yeshiva is difficult for some, but for me was quite simple. One of the rabbis from the yeshiva came to introduce the yeshiva to us 12-th graders, and I was very impressed with him. The impression he left on me convinced me to visit the yeshiva and see what it was like. I enjoyed it very much and decided to spend the next few years of my life in that yeshiva.

Life in yeshiva was very different than high school. Studying torah is given the utmost importance, and you are called upon to take it seriously. However, no exams are held and there is no roll call, and one must exercise considerable discipline in order to not abuse this freedom.

I did a little progress, but it felt like I would have a lot of disabilities in future. My doctors said I would never do karate again. I disbelieved him and started training again. It was painful, it was saddening, I had to start it all over. The physical pain was imperceptible to emotional. The progress was frustrating. I almost started to believe my doctors' words.

13,Male,20,"I would discuss my opinion about the  gays groups and why the church does not agree to get a gay couple be married.

before straight people get married they should not make sex because this considered a sin so they can wait until they get married and only then they can make sex.

so when the church does not agree to get gay couple married that say that they should not make sex all of there life because they can not get married and if they be together and they make sex this will be a sin .

and this is not fair in my opinion .

because that motivate them to make a sin and they don't have a solution so I think that the church should think again about this and agree to get gay people married and live together.

I think that the church had evidence from the bible not to agree to get gay couple get married and I for sure respect that but still I think that the life has been changed from that time and now the church may think again about that matter.

I believe that the best way to learn new things is to experience them yourself.



After my military service, I have decided to travel to China and was deeply inspired by the Chinese culture which is radically different from anything I have experienced before. It was a big challenge to communicate with the locals, as most of them do not speak any English. However it was great fun and one of the best experiences I ever had.

17,Female,19,"My opinion on religion.

Lets go back roughly 4000 years back ,to the days of our ancestors

who lived here in Kna'an.

Before the days of the 10 Commandments

, before any sort of rules were existed.

Before the days of science people did not know to explain the things that were happening around them, day ,night ,winter summer ,illness, they credited it all to a being that could not be seen ,a being that created everything around them.

So the village elders chose to teach morals to the people through that being a 'god'.

And so came the 10 Commandments. 10 rules that in our perspective are very basic and obvious but were not at the time, so those rules came to unite the people and give a meaning to their life.

Today we see people abuse their religion to make others feel bad in the good scenario and dead in the bad one.

 nowadays we should know better, we know  what is causing everything we see. We are united for the countries we live in and not in our religion ,we should thrive to be good people for the good in it and not for a 'prize' that is promised to us by 'god'.

We are all people. Gays, blacks, Muslims , Jews , we all have a soul and a beating heart and I can not accept someone banning other human being for not falling into their  definition of that religion.

In my opinion religion is outdated and its time we realize we are all one, and no one should Dictate you how to live your life.",The Left box,Speed!,Door B

Had went from sitting in a while chair to walking with a little help.

I don't really know what exactly made the difference, was it the god teacher they had, or the fact that the big animal can sense that they are special,

And you need to treat them with delicate and cushion.

You could see a horse, acting wild with one person, and once you place a special kid on him, being so delicate that it really amazes me.

that big animal is very special, from one side you need to be very firm with it, otherwise it won't listen to you and bad things can happen,

you might fall, get kicked/bite or worse.

But once the horse knows you, and trusts you, you and him are a team. He will do almost anything for you, because he knows you won't try to harm him.

and that special bond helps the kids, they finish the lesson, in which they played with a ball from the back of the house, or maybe just walked with him.

1. Finding a person to be with is affected with the money race, because people translate wealth as a good property and choose people according to it..

On the other hand, the money race sometimes demands a more  stressful life, and may produce health problems because of that.

25,Male,21,"Academic Reserve - Is it for anyone?



We would often hear about the Academic Reserve program, and arguments that go from how it's the best course of action to a life ""end game"" choice. However, looking deeper into the subject would reveal that it is not such a uni-polar decision as both sides of the argument try to portrait it, in fact it's a decision that is going great lengths into ones personality and other life aspects. However we will discuss this matter shortly, after an introduction with your truly writer.



I am an Academic Reserve student, currently on my 6th semester, and ever since I've signed up I am still pondering whether my choice has been a good one or not, after lengthy debates with my fellow students, I have come to a conclusion that there is no definite answer, we can however create a scheme that will help future generations to decide whether the program is up to their character type or not. This is of course advisory only, and could only give general guide lines.



Subjects of interest. Many of us in our late high school years didn't know what occupation would be our point of interest exactly. We knew which subjects are more interesting to us and which are less, however as narrow as they are, this does pose a certain character type.

Or does it?



Many people would discover that this assumption is, well, wrong. This is due to how light and only barely touching the real material is our high school studies are. Many things, when delved deeper into, will become tedious and boring rather than inspiring and interesting. However, during our military years and the little time afterwards we get to know ourselves better and what possible future occupation might be deemed by ourselves as ""good"" or ""interesting"". In Academic Reserve we often don't have that freedom of discovery, and more than that - once we did make the choice changing a subject is a VERY hard matter. So with that in mind - you need to know EXACTLY what interests you as a point of studying, as changing this later on might prove hardy and perhaps even impossible.



Next would be the future provision of ourselves. Do we know what we wish to do in the next 4 years? Perhaps the 10? Academic Reserve takes a lot of ahead planning, and if you are not the type of such heavy commitment, that course is very doubtfully for you. There are however the types that can easily cooperate with that fact, and will even find in such laid ahead pavement a comfort, rather than harassment.

After going off-road towards the beach we noticed some rocks. They were really hard to pass with the quad bike, but after hard work we managed to do that. Suddenly we saw a strange looking soldier who was shouting at us. The soldier came closer to us and he looked as confused as we were. While the soldier called for backup I noticed he had a Turkish flag on his uniform, I immediately realized what happened. We accidentally crossed the international border between northern and southern Cyprus. After a long interrogation by the army we passed to the police custody. The police officers acted irritated at first. They were angry because I sat with my legs crossed (few years later I read that this is considered disrespectful in the Turkish culture). But after a while it seemed that we have more in common than we though. After I sang them a Turkish song that I know, they began being totally positive towards us. The procedure said we should spend at least few days arrested. But they did a courtesy to us and let us go the same day.

I believe everyone should try and grow their own food, such as Mangoes, Tomatoes (Like I do, in a pot outside my dormitories apartment), and even potatoes and such.

As soon as we all realize that growing vegetables for food is really easy, and do it ourselves, it may be possible to reduce meat eating, so that the horrible things we hear about the meat industry will stop.

As I recall there was a person who said all of the world resources will run out as the population grows, however, as we did find a way to workaround this problem, we should probably try and take it a step further, and start growing food at home.

Peppers are really easy to grow as well, and so are beans, chickpeas, garden peas and a lot of other types of edible plants.

So I took a loan from my parents and flew to China with an open ticket, open mind and no plans whatsoever. This led to the best six months of my life!



My tour of the east began in China. I was alone and very confused at first. Beijing is huge and literally no one speaks English! My first day was exhausting. Like I've mentioned before, I'm not big on planning, so there I was, hiking the streets of Beijing in the late May sun, with a 20 kg backpack and no clue as to where I should go. Asking strangers for directions was pointless because no one speaks English. You don't even see tourists on the street. Just thousands and thousands of Chinese people. It took me four hours to finally find a place to stay at which ended up as the most expensive place I've stayed at in my entire trip. 



Starting out on my own wasn't easy. Especially in a place as foreign as China. But soon I learned to open myself to experiences and people and got along just fine. I would tell you of each and every incredible day and experience I've had on these six months away from home, but you asked for a short essay so I'll finish with this: after a month of exploring China I went with the current and continued to Thailand, Laos, Cambodia, Nepal and finally India( to which I returned last August for a couple of months).

I don't enjoy putting effort in a training routine, even though I know it is healthy and important to me.  As a result I have come to the point in my life where I am under weight, am in absolute horrible shape and can barely go on a run without fainting because of the stress.

So I decided to make a change.  I decided to make a gym membership and start working out.

The lab is worth only one and a half academic points and it is well known across the faculty that the amount of time it consumes is way larger than its worth. Although the grades are considered to be high, many students consider it to be unfair, and some of its requirements are draconic. Each lab session requires you to either prepare a report or to study for an exam, and while most of the theoretical material is covered in previous courses, there is still a lot of material we have to study ourselves, sometimes from advanced courses, and sometimes material not covered in undergraduate level courses. There have been attempts to negotiate with the head lecturer of the course, but as far as I know they were all in vain. I personally have proposed a simple offer to help reduce the difficulty of a specific lab, for which I studied for almost 2 days, but the professor did not accept it, claiming that what I proposed was to drop an integral part of the lab and that I will thank him in the future for teaching me how to solve such a problem.

40,Male,24,"For the Purpose of this essay I would like to discuss the current political situation in Israel with regards to the recent elections.



During the campaign season the political debate of almost every party was about ""kill or be killed"" as in, it's either them or us - they will destroy this country and we will defend it.

As a result of this, the general public eventually voted from fear and not from reason or logical thought. This applies for both sides of the political map.



What bothers me most about the recent elections is the absence of real debate. The candidates were more interested in bashing the opposing party than actually addressing the issues this country faces. This is a dangerous precedent due to the fact that election season is usually the time for everyone to speak up and be heard. From the poor to the sick, from the farmers in the Negev to the Surgeons in Ram bam Hospital.



Another strange symptom of these elections is the absence of the word ""Peace"" and the overuse of the word ""Iran"". Some might argue that security comes first and that preserving life is more important than preserving quality of life. That is, in my opinion, the most dangerous assumption one can make. 



Consider the following: with the failing education system we have today, in 20-25 years this country will be defended by soldiers that can barely read. And they will be defending a poverty stricken population that can't afford healthcare nor housing.



As it seems that the next elections are just around the corner, the public needs to make itself heard. I don't care who they vote for, I care that the candidates know what matters to the public is not just Iran or Gaza, important and dangerous as they may be, but quality and sustainability of life in the country.",The Left box,Speed!,Door A

44,Male,24,"THE MAGIC OF SPORTS



Almost Each and every one of us like sports. from racket games like tennis and squash to ball games as basketball and soccer, to even martial arts and chess.

we play it in the neighborhood, we go to gym, watch it on TV and read about it in the internet and newspapers.

one might think that sport is only a minor aspect of our lives and not saw influent one. but the truth can be 180 degree opposite.



A good example can be found on the financial aspect of sports, and its influence of the average joe.

the sports industry earns and spends milliards of dollars witch comes from the pocket of every one of us eventually.

we pay for merchandise, we pay for pay per view channels and we pay on games tickets.

While we all complains about the enormous amounts that managers in the public sector (or even in the private one) earns,

we never accuse great sportsmen as Michael Jordan and Leo Messi for their profits, even when they are much  greater than those we are so enthusiastically

despise.



Even on the political arena sportsmen can sometimes contribute more than ""real"" politicians.

for example, Didier Drogba, an Ivory coast native helped his country throughout a peace process to be held.

another notable occasion is the ""Ping pong diplomacy"" in which USA and CHINA exchanged ping pong players, a step that forward the first visit of president Nixon on a Chinese soil.



Sports affects us all, straightly on our fitness and life habits, but although on a much greater scale than we can usually imagine.

We as humans naturally tend to do that, unintentionally for the most time.

The complexity of game play options usually determine the ""lifespan"" of the game as far as I'm concerned, along with the overall skill level required to play the game (prefer games that require mediocre to high skill levels to play as they are usually more challenging and less random oriented).

When considering social interaction I usually prefer co-op games, where I enjoy the added challenge of adjusting to team mates.

When playing, nothing else in the world matters to me more than the point is currently being played out. Tennis, in my opinion, is the 'perfect' sport. It meshes 2 important aspects every sport should have - the body and the mind.



To excel in tennis one important ability is to hit the ball in the optimal way, requiring coordination, strength, control and agility. There are many types of shots that must be mastered, including the basic ground strokes, serves, drop shots, lobs and smashes. If an opponent realizes that you are weak in a particular kind of shot, he will exploit it. 



Just as important as the physical aspect is the strategy involved. There are many different types of shots, and knowing when to attempt each kind of shot will determine who will win the point most of the time. Hitting the ball hard and deep is not going to win very many points if your opponents can predict it and adjust accordingly. You must keep them guessing, and use the right combination to win the point. Also, the ability to find your opponents' weaknesses can allow you to win more points by attacking it.

I worked as a bartender in large concerts, through a big company who specialize in such events. for instance I worked there when Shlomo Artzi showed, the 'Caveret' band, 'Revivo's project' and many others. concerts with so many people need drinking, in some concerts alcohol is even necessary for some people. anyway after 8 hours at the bar serving, running and smelling too, me and my friend, James, another bartender who worked with me in some concerts offered me to give a ride on his motorcycle. we did it before once, he was responsible, mature, also paramedic- a reliable man. even though I was tired as hell- I thought to myself: ' if he is driving he probably not tired in me. I'm in safe hands'.



we signed all the papers and start to walk to the motorcycle. we put helmets, he told me again how to sit and I was just stunned when the powerful vehicle started humming-such a beautiful sound. I have many fears-one of them is bikes, the speed, the wind against you-looks to me like kind of some extreme way to get home. what's wrong with busses?

we started to ride, ride through the big hill we were in the bottom of it in work and I remember myself shouting to his ear: ""hey James! I have wife and kids, drive safely!"". of course I don't have wife and kids, I'm single. 22. well we both laughed at the traffic light. green light, started driving and accelerating, in the back of my left eye I noticed a big yellow bus.

Growing up, I studied at the 'Hebrew Reali school' in Haifa, when most of the high school period (majoring physics and computers) besides going to school I was a semiprofessional cyclist with highlights such as 2006 Israeli road champion and place 39 at the cycling world cup which took place in Belgium. Continuing with the cycling path during my army service was a strong temptation, but I have decided I want to do a more profound service, trying to be a pilot in the Israeli air force. After 6 months of training at the pilot academy I discovered I much prefer solid ground and transferred to the 'YAHALOM' unit. 'YAHALOM' is a combat engineering Special Forces unit where I served at the bomb squad Special Forces branch. I finished my service after four and a half years due to the fact I chose to continue an extra year and a half of beyond mandatory service. My rank is Sargent first class and during my service I participated in a lot of different operations at different locations. One highlight from my service was participating in the 'birthright' program as a soldier (see: http://www.birthrightisrael.com), where I was lucky to meet some lifelong American friends.  After participating in the program I was offered to take part in their speaking campaign associated with the IDF, my participation in the campaign included flying to the US in order to speak in front of different Jewish communities around the states regarding my IDF and 'birthright' experiences.

I would like to discuss all that is wrong with the movie ""Fifty Shades of Grey"".

A while ago I was violently forced by my girlfriend to watch the aforementioned movie at the theater. At first, since I came with no expectations, I was OK with the what was going on  the screen. But then I started noticing some ridiculous stuff.

First of all, how in the world does a 27 year old billionaire, CEO of an international corporation has so much free time?? No way in hell a person of that status can afford to take long weekends or disappear for days in order to... have kinky sex??

Second of all, how lazy were the film makers had to be to compress the entire ""falling in love"" process of Mr. Grey with Ms. Steel into one short, not very verbal, kind of weird and very insecure on her behalf interview!

Another thing I was deeply bothered by was the Logic of Ms. Steel while deciding to take Mr. Grey up on his offer. 

I mean, -""Oh, he's a rich and handsome mysterious stranger. Why wouldn't I be his weird sex slave?"" is not very realistic. I am all for trust among people, but not ""five year old girl offered to play with a puppy by a rapist looking stranger"" kind of trust.

I have travelled for 3 months across Japan, visiting the main island, Honshu, and a few smaller ones- Hokkaido, Shikoku and Kyushu. During my trip I went to the usual attraction, such as Tokyo, Kyoto, and Hiroshima etc. Although those cities are indeed a must, the best experiences for me were in all the small, other places. In Hokkaido I met great people - 3 Iron Man participants, who took me along with them to a tournament that was held in Lake Toya, an amazing women, who I met on a day trip in one of the volcanic mountains, and she took me to unique local places in her car, introduced me to her husband, a hair dresser, and put me in an authentic Kimono while her husband fixed my hair. In Shikoku I danced with the local people and very few foreigners to the Awa Odori festival. In Kyushu I visited a beautiful castle in Kumamoto, danced in an unexpected local festival and travelled with a local friend to a legendary cave surrounded by beautiful river and waterfalls.

The decision to make it there was pretty easy - we thought that there is no substitute for the warmth and atmosphere that we can get by doing it there.

It's not an easy task - many of the things that you don't have to worry about when planning a wedding in a ""traditional"" place, like electricity, lights, toilets, and many more, are a main concern.

It has also a financial aspect - again all this extra Suppliers that we needed to hire were a main cost.

On the other side, there is no doubt in my mind that the pros exceeds the cons.

First, We enjoyed very much from all the planning process, which was very  intense. 

In addition, the result was something that I think we simply couldn't achieve somewhere else. It was something completely ours, and I think that it really stood out.

Many of the guests said that they felt that they are a part of a very special thing. The atmosphere was great. The sounds, colors, smells, and tastes where all harmonized together to a very special event. 

For us, of course it's a lifetime event. but if some of our guests will remember this wedding as something special, than I think we achieved for sure what we wanted to - a wedding that is a little different than all others.

59,Female,23,"This is the story about how and why I became a vegetarian. I am now 23 years old and have been a vegetarian of over 10 years. when I was about 12 I began exploring where my food came from. The internet is full with very explicit descriptions about animal cruelty, the meat industry and the disadvantages of a carnivore diet. 

I wasn't the biggest meat eater to begin with so it wasn't hard for me to gradually  remove all meat and fish from my diet and I started feeling more conscious about my environment. I realized I didn't want to take part in eating animals. My family, of course, continued to eat meat and still is till this day. I have never tried to force my beliefs on them, and today I even cook fish and meat meals for my boyfriend (I just don't taste it during preparation.. ) 

I have tried being a vegan for a while (cutting out eggs and dairy products) but it was simply to hard and I felt like in my beliefs, being a vegetarian was enough for me. also, it was hard to stay healthy when you can't eat so many things. 

I believe it is important to find something in life that is meaningful to you and stick to it. As a vegetarian I've learned to notice what I eat, and to make sure I don't suffer from any deficiencies. ",The Right box,Stop!,Door B

62,Male,19,"Animal rights is the topic I'd like to present in this short essay. For some reason, most people have a hard time accepting the notion of animal rights. Be it laziness, the power of habits, or just plain old cruelty - the suffering of animals just doesn't move people to the right conclusion. 



It is my strongest belief that out morality is a clear reflection of our behavior towards the weakest and most vulnerable. Obviously, those who have no interest in minimizing the suffering of all living creatures, aren't of exemplary moral fiber. We rightfully expect empathy towards the less fortunate human beings, and respect those who are involved in reliving their pain. Yet caring for those whose voice is seldom heard - the animals abused by the food industry - is, at best, seen is meaningless; at worst, it is disregarded as an annoying fad. 



Nevertheless, there are various sound and practical reasons to care about the rights of animals. For example, even the hardest to convince of the capacity of animals to suffer will stay speechless when faced with the unquestionable impact animal farming has on the environment. To sum it up, there is a strong connection between animal rights and the well being of humans. ",The Left box,Speed!,Door B
63,Male,24,"Why I like movies and video games so much.

So, why do I indeed? Beside both being a hobby of mine, watching a good( or even a bad, actually) movie or playing a video game is the pure feeling of escapism. I adore escapism. Life is hard, and not always that great ( especially at the Technion *frown*) and sometimes a need to just escape, and for a moment, live another life, comes up. There are many ways of escapism, be it forms of art like books or music, other hobbies like sports, or even drugs and alcohol - all of the above helps to let go and live an ""alternate life"" in a way for some moments.

For me, the need to create escapism moments during the week are in priority, for else I'm starting to get somewhat depressed. It may not be the mentally healthiest of all attitudes, but I am what I am. Encapsulating yourself in another life, where you're the hero, or can relate to one, helps putting problems in a context, and let go of some steam and stress. It's a way to get emotionally involved in something more interesting then Hedva and stuff, and develop a wider, different perspective.

We've reached a point where it is considered ""uncool""; sort of speak, to be in to science. I find it absolutely ridiculous.

Moreover, our nature science graduates are one of the few assets that Israel has for its advantage, giving Israel the much-appreciated name ""Start-up Nation"". Many words have already been written about it and much has already been spoken of it and of the Jewish mind. That comes regarding the fact that the percentage of Jews winning a noble prize far exceeds their percentage in the world population.



Therefore, we must encourage young people to join and find the pleasure of discovery as a society which is determined to keep moving forward.



Some may claim that I'm speaking nonsense for we've reached a turning point in human history when culture is no longer the key to success. It is still a great aspect in our lives, but not as before. I embrace this belief and suggest that in light of this, we should use this insight in order to educate the following generations to come to be doubtful and curious than we've ever been before.

I got Nemo when he was 7 weeks old, and Weighed 5 kilos, now he is a year and 3 months old and weighs 36 kilos.

Raising such a dog is an amazing experience, I get to take him with me to almost every place I go to, I learn how to educate and to train him, and of course I get plenty of love from him.

It also a very important role and it is not easy to be so strict with the dog.

The reason for the strict education is that this dog is the eyes of the blind people, and the blind person relies fully on the dog and that's why there is no place for the dog to not behave as he is expected to.

The way to do it was to start building a homemade Segway, which is a two wheeled platform that can balance itself. 

At first, I didn't have a clue on how I was going to even start, but I decided to begin by measuring the slope between the faculty and my apartment. Then I started learning about Segways, how they work, etc. As the time past, I felt that I was beginning to understand them better, and I started taking courses that could enhance my understanding on what to do. Some of them even included parts of small projects which I used in order to utilized in order to progress in my own project.

The peak was when I needed to start my degrees' final project, and my Segway project was accepted. 

Today I added a friend who helps me, and together we've almost finished a first prototype of the robot. If everything continues this way, by the end of this year I would be able to ride my do-it-yourself Segway from my Nesher apartment to the Technion. 

Wish me luck ;P",The Right box,Speed!,Door A

I checked if it possible to get extra new Israel shekels. First stage was to write down short story about something. So first of all I thought to myself ""what is  crap""? What should I write about? The second one get me until here and it was like: ""I can do this and it will be nice try to make something out without nothing"". Now after a little break to put my small one asleep I opened word and started to count the amount of words and it got only to 167. Where should I get more? At the same moment I heard my little one started to snore and it got few more words now! With a little smile on my face I continued to my few extra money. At this point I got little upset of thinking what could I do at the time I was writing but hey I got the amount of words think I love my story and the idea of it!

82,Male,30,"I would like discuss about something that I find interesting - Combat Fighting as a sport. I argue that this is the ultimate way to claim dominance over another human being as something that is primal as the world itself.



Think about it, why do we feel excited about football or basketball, does it really that important putting the ball over the line or inside the net, does the point carry any use outside the court or field?

Of course not, it only symbolize the dominance we showcase in over our opponent, and as I mentioned, the form of combat fighting act the same way, we present our skills and clash against our adversary as pure as it can possibly get. People were fighting ever since history, it's in our DNA, we do it and we like it. The ultimate proving ground for soul digging in order to overcome all obstacles.   



As a regulated sport I believe combat fighting is exciting and enjoyable to watch and participate. It gives you motivation and inspiration, teaches you to think and make strategies, and above all keeps you fit physically. People how practice it feel more relaxed, focused and tend to create and find better solutions to many hurdles they come across. For then nothing is impossible or too hard to do, they feel they can climb the highest mountain only with the strength of belief.

83,Female,25,"my life with Italian:

my father studied architect in the university of Venice in Italy.

he moved to Italy with my mother in order to learn there 2 years before I was born.

my parents learned the language when they arrived there. the spoke Italian fluently.

I've lived there for 5 years. I spoke Italian better than Hebrew.

when we arrived to Israel I realized that me speaking Italian is making me a stranger, I was different from the others kids. I decided to stop speaking Italian.

I refused to speak Italian and to listen to it, every time someone started talking to me in Italian I just ran away.

I completely forgot the language. for years I didn't understand a word. I think I just blocked it.

learning other languages was always easy for me. I've learned French in high school and Spanish from the television.

this year I decided to confront Italian. I believe that the language is still somewhere in my brain.

I signed to the Italian course in the Technion and surprisingly I realized that I understand everything. the teacher is speaking and I understand!

I am learning the grammar now and its easy for me. who knew that it could come back that easily.

I started listening to Italian music and watching TV series with Italian dubbing.

I work in an organization that promotes environmental awareness among students and engineers and my main goal is to promote science and technology education among children in all ages.

Our country's main asset is its people and their minds, ideas, dreams and innovations. We are called ""the start-up nation"", but there is a chance we will not be worthy of this title in the future, due to lack of interest in science and technology among children. 

By making science education approachable and not threatening, my colleagues and I hope to encourage children to pursue this field in the future. We do this by using fun activities, that do not include the classic scientific characteristics. We show that science is everywhere and that everyone can be a scientist.

Using approachable materials and content also allows us to encourage the participation of children that might come from a difficult background and can not afford expensive extra curricular activities. ",The Left box,Stop!,Door A

My older brother started brewing beer when I was around 16, and I thought it was really interesting so I decided to make some as well. I started with extract brewing which means using concentrated wort and adding maltodextrins for mouth feel. I made a few batches like that but eventually wanted to move on to more sophisticated beers, and was limited by extract brewing. I briefly did some partial extract brews, which uses some grain and some concentrate, but finally started doing all grain batches which uses only grains. The grains for beer making are usually barley, with some others for taste like wheat, rye, and corn. Since starting I have come to appreciate the hard work that goes into every beer people drink, and the new styles that come out. In addition I have also started to grow hops, which is a plant that flowers, and the flowering cones add the bitterness to beer to offset the sweet malt flavor. So far I have probably made around 15 batches, and I still have so much left to learn. It has been such a rewarding hobby, both for myself and for others.

105,Female,22,"Since I remember, every summer holiday is time for a vacation abroad with my family. My parents, sister and I used to have so much fun during these trips.  My mother used to be responsible for all the hard work that's needed to be done in advance: deciding where and when we'd fly, arranging everything from car pool and hotels reservations to helping her daughters with their luggage. She always wondered if her decisions where right, and even during the trip itself she sometimes had regrets. However each and every one of these trips was a wonderful experience for our family, not only because of the amazing places we've been to, but because we were together. This was the only time of the year that all four of us were together from sunrise to sunset. My parents always worked very hard, arriving home late in the evening. The vacations reunited us as a family and we actually had many experiences, talks and a lot of laughter together. I was expecting the family trip almost all year round, just to get to see my parents relaxed and having fun instead of working so hard. Lately, I've been thinking about how my future family would be. Will I work so hard so that we'd be able to spend so much money in the summer or will I prefer working less hours a day so that I'll have quality time with my family all year round?

106,Male,21,"Hello, my name is <PERSONNAME106> and I live on a small town near Netanya. Whenever I have some free time I like to run, especially in the nature. On the last summer vacation I ran so many times in the fields outside my town that I felt very familiar and comfortable with every path.



Especially I like to see ""The Lake"" which is a cliff with a view to a big lake made out of rain waters. The Lake represents for me a feeling of freedom, connection to nature and relaxing. One day my friends and I were at home and looking for adventure so I decided that we will make a dream come true and build a raft and set sail in the lake. They liked the idea too and we started collecting floating materials all over the town. When we had enough of those we brought them to the lake and got started on building it.



After a few hours the raft was ready. We named it ""The Dovra"" after a raft that appeared in a book I just read. We threw the Dovra in the water. I was the one to go first, I found a way to the water through the bushes and swam to the Dovra and climbed on it. It carried me nicely. Than another friend climbed too, and when the last friend started to climb we were too heavy and all the floating materials popped out all over the lake!

When I was studying in school, I was pretty sure that there is not any doubt and our planet appeared about 5 billion years ago, after that somehow appeared life, etc.  It is important to say that I grew up in Russia, in absolutely secular environment. I was very amazed, when had heard in the local university from teacher of history, that theory about creation still be popular enough even among some scientists, because (and there my world was shaken a bit) evolution does not explain everything and there is some difficulties with it.

I said that my world was shaken just a bit, and it is completely true. I was about 17 years old and had had other things on the mind. However, sometimes I wondered which theory is true.

Now I am sure (maybe, word ""believe"" suit better, but when you believe, you are sure) that creationism is true. Darwin's evolution seems to be mirage for me. Too many things are not explained (although it is claimed here and there that ""scientists proved""), such as complicated systems of organs. Most organs connected in complicate systems, in which every detail is useless without others. For example, an eye will not ""work"" alone. There is a district in a brain, which can control it and decode information, taken from it. There is a nerve, which connects between the brain and the eye. And there is not any evidence that the nerve, the eye and the district can be useful without other elements, that leads to conclusion that they appeared together.

It was the days of the second Intifada, and as riots and terror attacks were starting up in Israel, the same kind of terror activity was targeted at us, the Israeli diplomats in Amman. 

Also, probably the most traumatizing experience was the day I came back home from school and found my home all packed-up, as we were being returned to Israel the next day. I didn't get to say goodbye to my friends or finish my library book.

When I first walked in, they told me not look right if I don't want to see the slaughter itself. Of course I looked. 

I was disgusting! The chickens are held crowded in a small cage. They do not look happy at all. The whole process of preparing the dead chickens for the freezing is also really revolting. The workers take out the internal organs in a conveyor belt.

And don't get me started on how hot dogs are made- feathers, bones and nails are all part of the ingredients.

Everyone wants to help their friends, but most of us do it their way, not his. The real help is given the helpee's way, not the helper, and the same goes for the gratitude given and received in that case. You can go through a lot of trouble while doing a favor, and eventually getting a mere thank you or a smile, when in fact, although not expecting something in return, you did want your friend whom you helped to acknowledge through what you have just been. 

On the other hand, sometimes the simplest gesture will result in overwhelming gratitude and appreciation, in a way you will be amazed how such a small did has made a difference in someone's hardship.

Sometimes I feel like a little rebel who never settles until she gets what she wants. I'm always open for new ideas, adventures and experiences.

Other times I feel like I'm actually the good girl who makes everyone proud.

130,Female,23,"The opinion that I am passionate about is feminism.

Many people, men and women alike, believe feminists are raging hairy-legged misandrists who are frustrated for not being able to find a husband. Some women believe in the principles of feminism but refuse to identify as such. The truth is, this beautiful believe is all about equality. There are many tiny inequalities in the world I used to be blind to, or just didn't care about. Now I see it everywhere - in the media, social media, the way people around me talk. 

Feminism is all about appreciating men and women for who they are and not for their gender, to free them of unnecessary gender stereotypes (men have to be strong; women have to be thin and pretty), to uproot the patriarchy to create a neutral, freer society.

For example - when a couple has a baby, it is expected of the woman to be the main caregiver, regardless of her career or desires. If she continues to peruse her career, she's a bad parent. If the father chooses to be the main caregiver, he is conceived as a 'super dad', a divine parental entity that agreed to give up his professional life for his children. 

Women are constantly evaluated for their appearance only. A recent example of that is parliament member Ayelet Shaked. No one would dedicate so much attention to the appearance of a handsome male politician; all that matters is their political opinions.

 You may think gender equality is here because women are allowed to vote and drive; the truth is, we're still miles away from an equal society.",The Left box,Speed!,Door A

A few years ago, when I was in the army, I set it as a mission to become an officer. It was important to me because I knew I could both contribute and learn from such a position. 

Upon encountering the course I had to pass a physical exam, and this I found to be a true challenge. I usually find intellectual exams to be easy, and don't usually have to prepare much for them. However, this was a new experience for me - the fact that I had to prepare for an exam for months in advance. 

The first time I went to the officer prep I didn't pass the physical exam, and was sent back to my unit. I felt like I had to prove to myself that I could face this challenge.

The second time not only did I pass the exam, but I was even able to help others finish the exam as well, which felt even greater.

That is the first long race I have ever participated in, and I was really thrilled to complete it, although I finished tired and exhausted.

Perhaps even more valuable than my engineering degree, I have learned how I can start learning about a new topic and get good at it pretty quickly.

After almost four years at the Technion, I have seen people get better at their studies and also seen people whom I thought were pretty smart to begin with struggle to keep up with their studies. Nobody is born a genius, everything is earned with hard work and sincerity. Of course, one needs to devote their hard work effectively by understanding what methods of learning work best; otherwise the hard work can be fruitless and can end up in frustration and lack of self-esteem.

Throughout the years, Israel has been frowned upon, Israeli products were boycotted and local entrepreneurs oppressed.  The reason for this all is the wrongdoings against the Palestinian nation, which are allegedly carried out on behalf of our government.

Needless to say, these claims lack any factual basis and should be regarded as a sign of cynical hypocrisy. Every now-and-then international media present us with images of massacre and destruction in the Middle East. These gruesome images are gladly devoured by the masses and are instinctively referred to Israeli armed forces and security services. In fact, most of these gory materials depict the atrocities committed by extremist Islamic organizations, far from Israeli soil. The material are usually crudely cut and cured together, therefore making it visible for anyone, who wouldn't turn a blind eye for the truth.

What would be the source of this deeply imprinted instinct of anti-Semitism? The answer to that - propaganda. Propaganda often funded and carried out by the same organizations mentioned.

It wasn't just you and some computer controlled characters, but real people who you could communicate with, share in-game adventures with, or just beat the crap out of, depending on the type of game you were playing. It was a whole new level of fun. And while multiplayer games usually focus on repetitive-competitive gaming style and cater to a certain kind of gamers, single player games gained their own place among gaming fans thanks to storyline based adventures, and focusing on the player as the main hero of the in-game events, something that is not really possible in multiplayer environments.

In this so called holiday, people gather around and light big fire, while eating bib and grilled potatoes. I get it, when I was young I enjoyed it very much- the preparations, collecting woods together, picking a good spot and guarding it during the day in shifts, till the night, all of that is very fun, but now when I older I realize that this is a harmful holiday for earth, for our nature, wild animals, air and our health (although not a 'life changing' experience). There are also many bad habits of some kids such as burning cats and dogs for fun. I find it horrible and I wish these people were catch and jailed. There are also many cases of fire going out of control, or people not putting it away good enough when they finish their night.

I think tradition is important but not a tradition which is bad and harmful for us all.  Today I realize that I wouldn't have want my own children to be a part of it because I can't find a good reason for us, a developed country, to keep having it while everybody is perfectly aware of its consequences- both educational and behavioral.

Having grown up exposed to a very Zionistic culture, and a strong Jewish education, I developed a will to join the rest of my Jewish brothers and sisters in our homeland - the land of Israel.

And so I drafted to combat service in August of 2010, but it was not clear what would come next.

150,Male,20,"Hello, I want to tell you about my experience dealing with the death of my father.

I think it will help to write about as part of me dealing with the situation , so everything started about 3 years ago as I started studying in the ""Technion's Mechina"" . My father started getting sick more often then he usually does, he was a person that dropped smoking when I was born worked in hard labor most is his life and at last years of his life he worked at a raw plastic plant and at an age of almost 50 still started from walking and got to running and even working out. But as my father all ways does he said it was nothing(as a kid I don't think I ever saw my father show any weakness ,and I think I have learned it from him or at list trying to ). At that time I didn't know that while I was studying in the Technion he and my mother was visiting the doctor often because his fever wasn't going down. They always told me it was nothing serious ,but while they thought I wasn't hearing they was talking about it and was heard something about blood in my father's colon , but at that time I didn't understand how bad was it. Eventually when I came back on one of the weekends my mother told me that my father was taken to the hospital and they operated him to remove a tumor they found. I was shocked inside and ever since was always worried about what will happen if it will get worst. Our problem in the family is that we were much closed to each other, they didn't want to bother me with their problems so it wouldn't make it harder for me to study and I did the same. When I look back at the whole story it's not very surprising. They always told what they couldn't avoid telling, so as time passed I always asked about how he is feeling and if the chemotherapy is helping , and at first it helped and he even started working out again but for some reason when the doctors changed his treatment a bit his situation started getting worst , and if ever saw people being treated with chemotherapy you know that as long as they keep getting it continues to consume the person slowly , first they lose appetite then the start vomiting ,lose weight , rushes all over the body and other skin problems , until the person can't even walk without a stick , each week I was coming back I was how I don't recognize my father anymore  but he always kept his pride , I saw how it is  eating  him from the inside that he can't support his family any more . That my mother must get out of her work when he needs her, when his friends from work have to leave work early to take him to the chemotherapy, he didn't like to be a burden on people never showed how much he is suffering inside . In one of the last talks I had with him I told him that I got accepted to the Technion, he told me that it will help him fight the disease I will never forget it. As time passed he started feeling really bad and eventually spent a lot of time In the hospital, he hated it there and always wanted to come back to our house, my father did a lot so she could take care over him, she found some one that will improvise a shower downstairs so he wouldn't have to go up the stairs, got him a hospital bed, but he was still in pain, so they started giving him medical marihuana and eventually when it didn't help even morphine , that's was really when I lost him , he was always sleeping , in the last time I saw him I had to feed him because he couldn't lift his arms , and he didn't talk just looked at me with a helpless look . One day at around 5AM my mother called me told me in a crying voice that my father is dead an hung up . I am not going to talk about the funeral to save you the reading , and I will skip two years later , I have learned a lot ever since found a girlfriend that supported me a lot , she was the only one I could talk with about it . And now I am afraid I will lose her too, so I decided to share my father's disease story to relieve some of the stress with whoever reads this.

Besides being passion to be an engineer, I also care about the environmental problems, the way we develop whether is sustainable or not, we can't sacrifice our natural resources to gain the economic growth, which is never a deal, the money we earn today, we need 10 more years, even more to reverse the damage we made to the nature, so that I have try my best to be environmental friendly and reuse the materials...I don't think this is a one man's job, but we need someone to start it, then we can have a better place.",The Left box,Stop!,Door B

I study for first degree in computer science expertise in Information systems.

Despite the fact that I like programming and other fields in computer science, I am also interested in information security and artificial intelligence.

But, I would like to talk about something entirely different which is related to physics. I always wonder whether we are alone in this universe that all the science fiction movies we watch can actually be the reality, and when I think about it, I feel a little frightened. How we would respond when an alien shows up. I know there are many theories about it, and there are some people claiming to see something like that.

Shall we take the example further and try to understand why, if we have such ability to change - won't we? is it because we are so indoctrinated to the point it is very difficult to change a mindset, and we have the ability to change perhaps we lack the willingness to. 

The human race is one thing, but society as a being is something of a different nature, truly an intriguing one, I, for one, am finding it with great sadness only a could have been situation rather than a genuine one for I don't believe in people's willingness to accept the other (generalizing...there are some good few out there).

I can talk about my night dreams, which are not so pleasant in many cases: In those dreams the world is about to collapse, and me and a few of my loved ones are trying to save ourselves, save the world, save something: but all in vain. So many dreams such as these were filling my nights.. Another dream, a better one: is when I'm flying. Well, mostly I am not flying, but gliding or hovering in some way, as if even in my dreams I realize that flying is impossible for me.

Now, for a more realistic dream: I think I would like to live somewhere east, maybe India. I don't want to be an engineer. I want to live freely, far away from here. I want to help people. I want to help animals- helpless animals that I would save from anyone who is trying to harm them. I want to wake up, late in the morning, stare at the endless sun, and smile. I want to know that I did something good in my life. I don't want to waste them in favor of earning money for huge corporations. I am not like that, I am not one of them.

On the second day, my spouse and I rented a car and drove to Zakynthos, which is a nearby island. This was definitely a wonderful day. Zakynthos is beautiful, with clear blue lagoons, and stunning white cliffs ending at the water. We rented a motor boat there, which we used to reach the Blue Caves, Zakynthos most famous attraction. These caves were formed in bottom of the cliffs, and are filled with sea water. Some of the caves are quite large, and it is possible to sail through them. 

However, one thing kept bothering me throughout this short vacation: The amount of homework I have to complete. I took my laptop with me, and worked some on the plane, on the train, and a bit in the hotel room, but the nagging feeling I should do more rarely left my mind. I kept thinking 'I should be studying instead of having irresponsible fun', and it is very hard to have fun this way. 

All in all, I really can't complain over a free vacation, but sometimes I'm sick of being a student - constantly having to work hard, with disregard to weekends and vacations.

 My original idea was to travel in New Zealand or go on a road trip around Australia. New Zealand is supposed to be one of the most beautiful places in the world but a bit to commercialized, and Australia is supposed to be less impressive but maybe a more special experience.

About two weeks ago, an earthquake has occurred in Nepal, and that gave me a new idea. Suddenly I started feeling that maybe just traveling for the sake of travelling is not the exact experience I am looking for. I felt that that would be a bit meaningless and that I would feel much more meaning full if I go to Nepal and help in the earthquake relief work. This kind of experience would also gain me some professional experience.

Now I have to decide. The last option has clear advantages, but still the first two ones are attractive as Australia and New Zealand are so far away from Israel, and I don't think I'll be back soon.

Anyway, whatever option I will choose, I am sure I will have very interesting 6 weeks before I go back to Israel to work and to study.

we - me and my boyfriend -  We started with Marseille which is a large port city where we stayed at a guest house of very nice people who prepared us in the morning a traditional French breakfast - baguette with jam and croissants.

Since the city is very large we stayed there for about two days in spite of hindsight we could shorten one day.

Then we rented a car and drove to Cassis, then went through some small villages full and some were staying we moved quickly.

Each had a different character and different view. 

Then we walked along the Ocean City ""Bontemps"" in French is her interpretation center and from there moved to the state of Monaco where we walked following the Princess of Monaco film.



Finally we returned to the city where the Cannes Film Festival and Taraneh's family friend and we spent the weekend there.

The city's beautiful and reminiscent in terms of the weather and the people of Israel.



Then we went to Nice and then back home to Israel.



I personally really recommend this trip. Is a romantic frenzy and feeling where some countries do together because of the cultural diversity and richness of the landscape there.

In addition, we have discovered is something interesting small towns have different ownership French language!

163,Male,24,"My name is <PERSONNAME163>, I'm 24 years old and I'm a study industrial engineering and management in the Technion.

I would like to express my opinion about the ""grades method"" that is very popular in today's education.

this method means that every student get a grade or appreciation by a clear scale of values.

On one hand, this method is necessary for us, the students. Because it lets us know how good we are in compare to other students, and if we need to improve. It also helps the teachers and the university to check the way of learning in this course.

In addition, if a student want to switch his university, he has to bring his grades, because the new university needs to know if the student is good enough for the institute.

On the other hand, we can't just ignore the disadvantages of the method. It comes with stress tests that worry the students very much.

If a student has a personal problem it may affect him badly in the test, and it can lead to low grades that not reflects the student's abilities.

In addition, different tests and teachers can cause incorrect evaluate of the different students and may confuse the education system. Maybe grade of 80 in some university is better than grade of 90 in other university. 

In my opinion, tests are important but they can't be the only source of evaluation of the students. I hope that the new minister of education will do something in this subject",The Left box,Speed!,Door A

166,Male,30,"When I was in sixth grade I lived for 6 months with my uncle's family for six months.

The reason that I did such a crazy thing, all by myself, was because I would always hear my mother talk about how good the American educational system is compared to the Israeli one. So one day I told her that I would like to go to the States and see what it's like.

Being without my family for such a long time wasn't as hard as one would think it should be for a 12 year-old, though I do remember carrying the night they had left. My uncle's family, including my aunt and cousin and niece, hosted me very nicely and accepted me as part of the family.

I went to Public School, one of two Jews in my class (I'm religious). My teacher and principle were also Jewish, so they helped me deal with walking around with a Kippah.

Israel is the beach in Tel Aviv, the view up north in Rosh Ha'nikra and the green beautiful Galil in the spring. Israel was also the place I was attacked by missiles at my own home when I was under 10 years old and spent long days and nights at our building shelter.

169,Male,19,"Here is a short essay on the Importance of a strong literary Foundation (i.e. why you need to read) 

Books, some of us love them and some of us hate them, but I think we all can agree that their importance is unparalleled. A book can teach us many things we don't know and all ready from a young age we are encouraged to start reading. But why?

First off, let's start with ""what can we learn by reading""? Well, I believe that reading can lend a hand at early childhood development. When your parents read you to sleep or you heard laureates and poets singing you to bed when you were young, you learned not only the everyday ""gaga gooing"" language of your parents but also ""real language"".   Real language is the language of the outside world, what your parents use at work, when instead of faced with a cute offspring they have to deal with hard bosses and annoying people. This introduction to ""real language"" can be very beneficial by helping children develop into healthy thinking humans.

        Secondly, the world of books and rhymes gives a great deal to ones imagination. When you are reading it's as if you are brought in to this magical world of imagery, adventure and thought that is just not present in the outside world. Imagination is a key component into human development and brings a little excitement into our sometimes boring life. People with none or hardly any imagination are dull, unthinking, depressed and less likely to succeed than those whom imagination is a part of their life. Many companies such as Disney, Pixar and The Learning Company base their entire marketing foundation on imagination. 

        There are many other reasons why a good literary foundation is important (I could expand but I'm afraid I already met my character limit and my brain would melt from exhaustion). To conclude I would like to leave you with something to think about, ""What would your life be like without books?"" Not a very pleasant thought, Huh?

Towards the end of the training I suffered a back injury that prevented me from continuing this specific role. As a result it had to be changed. From then on and until the end of my service I was a company commander assistant. 

I'm in my 4th semester, studying Electrical engineering. 

I'm also get a scholarship from impact and today I completed 130 hours of volunteer for this year. 

Last year I volunteered in 'Apple' organization. It's has the same name as the famous Apple (with the Mac computers and the IPhone) and it's vision is to provide an equal opportunity to Israel's socially disadvantaged communities through technological tools and the development of life skills. 

I was taking part in 'Net@'- a program to encourage technological excellence and social leadership for students in grades 9-12. The program, combining advanced technological training with social values, has in the past decade became a significant tool of social, academic and employment mobility in Israel.",The Left box,Speed!,Door B

After finishing my Jewish high school, I decided leave all my friends and made Aliya to Israel. My parents divorced in 1990. That is very hard in Russia to bring up three children alone, without any help. Unlike most Russian Jews, she had no higher education. She started but failed to finish after we were born.

My mother understand that she cannot pay for our high education. She decided that we have to move to Israel. In 2005 I made Aliya without my family through the teenagers' program 'SELA'. I began slowly, by taking Hebrew classes and also prepared myself to the psychometric exams in the Absorption Center, I had lived in, in a small town called Karmiel. There I took part in a Vigilante project. At the end of this program I was recruited by the Air Force of Israeli Defense Forces. It was a hard decision for me because in Russia girls do not go to the army, but now I understand that if a person wants to get somewhere in life that life will be full of hard decisions anyway.

On one day, we met a Jewish writer and we heard about his hitchhike traveling from Berlin to Jerusalem. It was really interesting.

It is an incredible village, there are Brazilians, Russians Ethiopians, French and Israelis students, thus we as students have learned much more than math, physics or history, we have also learned about living with different cultures, about living with people with different ways of thinking. We have learned how to not despise nor disrespect other people, even if we do not speak the same languages, even if we do not understand each other. So there is a point I would like to underline here, one of the biggest reasons I like to study in the Technion and be part of the Technion's society is that here, in the Technion, we live with a vast diversity of cultures. There students from all around the world, there students from America, from Italy, from China, from Israel, from France, and so on...The fact that delights me is that here, like in the village where I started my life in Israel, we are all capable of living and working together and in peace, even if there are so many differences between us.

The agony starts even before you bored the train, when you try to check when the train leave the station you check the train website/app only to discover an 'estimation' , this might work well in Europe but not in Israel, no , here the train is late ALL the time, it is late so often that the benchmark for accuracy is measure in ten minutes, meaning if the train isn't late by more then 10 min it is considered on time and even with this benchmark the train is (according to the train website) is accurate only in 95%. But the train refuse to give current location of the train so it might be late it might not you will only know when you are there with not much to do about it.as a frequent user I find myself coming in late 3 out of 5 train rides.

After that, we were told that we were being video taped for the purpose of the experiment. We played a neat game - each of us had to build a part of a considerably large object from Lego pieces. We weren't allowed to communicate with each other, until we finished building our own piece, We were allowed to trade pieces with each other, but only using their names, which we previously memorized.

A strong opinion that I have matured during my relatively short life, and that I am proud to hold today, is that you have to explore other cultures, get to talk with people that you have never thought of talking to and travel in unfamiliar places. 

If you create relationships with as many different people as you can, then you are able to better understand their traditions and opinions and become a more tolerant person. In addition, both sides can benefit from hearing what and how the other side thinks and behaves. 

In my opinion, it is crucial to understand the difference among the different groups in the population you grow up in, and not to be stuck only to a certain line of thought, because stereotypes and prejudice are a weak point that we all sin in it from time to time. 

Personally, I have explored many cultures and people through traveling around the world, and by creating strong connections with people that not necessarily grew up in my native environment.

205,Female,24,"There are places I keep returning to in my dreams. They do not exist in the real world, but in my dreams they are as real as my backyard and as I dream on I never seem to notice those are not real places, because from some reason I can never tell myself that I am dreaming while the dream is on progress as some people seem to be able to do. A good example is the secret Gaudi park that exist only when I sleep.

I dreamed of this park several times, and therefore I can remember it quite well, unlike most of my dreams. If you have ever been to Barcelona you would know that Gaudi was a pretty extravagant architect, and every architecture work of his, whether it is an apartment building or a park, is to be noticed and remembered. Therefore, I find it odd that the park in my dreams was planned by him, since this park is secret and hidden from the eye. It is even weirder when you think about it closely, since this park is located in the heart of Tel Aviv, a city in which there is no room for excessive real-estate, and has no connection to this Spanish architect. Dreams, as you should know, are rarely logical, but despite that I find myself getting pretty upset about those ""plot knots"" while I am awake. I think it has something to do with the fact that I strongly wish my dream park would be a real place. ",The Left box,Speed!,Door B
206,Female,26,"I want to talk about the situation of stray dogs and cats in Israel:

 the main goal is to encourage people to spay and neuter their animals 

and also the ones from the street if they can. 

Formal documents show that every year at least 50000(!!!) dogs 

are anesthetized in the  municipal quarantines. 

While many more dogs and cats are dying in the streets

from: dehydration, diseases, abuse, car accidents and more.

In that situation the idea of ""producing"" more animals very morally wrong.

Some people want to ""experience"" birth, they can just go to the nearest

shelter or quarantine and adopt some puppies/ kittens 

(cubs are very frequently die in places like that because their 

immune system isn't strong enough). 

Other people want dog/cat from only a specific breed 

which seems to me really petty. 

Anyway the most important thing is to match your life style with the dogs personality. 

Many shelters do that with the help of volunteers and dog trainers. 

Not to mention that many of the breeds of both cats and dogs 

are actually genetic defects which hurt severely the life quality of those animals. 

While cats' breeds almost don't have specific personality and based only on looks. 

The only humane way to solve this situation is to spay and neuter, 

some municipalities do that but they never have enough budget. 

So if you have some extra money- spay and neuter the cats in your yard, 

or pay some one to do that or call the municipality and ask them to do that. 

If you want to get a cat or dog- adopt don't buy! 

In those hot days please put a bowl of water for the stray cats, 

many of them suffer from dehydration.

At first I thought that this will be an easy task, as I'm a very opinionated person and I can usually go on and on about practically anything. The problem began when I realized how vague the task was - just write 250 words about anything. How do I choose? Several options came to mind, but I dismissed all of them for different reasons. Eventually I decided to write about that time I was asked to write a 250 word assay. I mean, it's only 250 words, how hard can it be? The first word count showed that I had 119 words. 'Not bad' I thought to myself, as I was almost half way there and the assay even looked more sophisticated and airs poetic then I believed it would. But then, all of the sudden, I hit a writer's block. How do you hit a writer's block writing such a short assay, I thought to myself? But the rhetorical question only helped so much, and I was still stuck with 60 words to go. The good thing about writing an assay with no rules except for 'don't plagiarize' is that you can do practically anything you want.

When I was 6 years old in kinder garden I had started to play football at Hapoel Kfar Saba but after two years I decided to leave the football and move to basketball. So at the age of 8 I signed up to basketball club of Hapoel Kfar Saba and played there for 10 years until I was recruited to the army.

For now, because I'm not playing anymore I have to be satisfied with watching games in the television.

But although I like playing basketball more, I enjoy to watch football more. My favorite team is Maccabi Haifa, I'm a fan of Maccabi Haifa from the age of 5. I didn't miss almost any game in the last two years, and even though Haifa is not in her best time these days I keep going to games and support my team.

210,Female,23,"Back in elementary school, I remember that time of the year in Lag Ba'omer when all the kids went out to the streets to find cutting boards for their bonfire. I was no different, of course, and I definitely participated in the boards seeking, hoping to find as much as possible, so that my class will have the biggest and most impressive bonfire in the whole area. Even though it was hot as hell (or at least as Israel can get in this time of the year), and despite of the fact that most of the times someone's dad could get enough wood for at least the whole neighborhood's bonfires, we saw this as an important experience you cannot miss. Something we can all do together, for an ""important cause"".



I remember one time that we all went out and started to search for our desire. At some point we went to someone's house, don't remember why. As we walked into the staircase, the shelter door was open. We came in and found there a huge hiding place of wood. ""This probably belongs to another class"", I thought to myself, and started to go up in the stairs. My classmates, however, were very excited about what their eyes saw, and without thinking twice, they started loading this treasure on our carts. I was shocked by the idea, and immediately left because I did not want to participate.



Years went by, and today when I think of Lag Ba'omer, I realize that I was a thief as well. True, I did not steal those logs, but this holiday is all about theft (or at least that's what we made of it). Kids steal from other kids, from building sites, and they even steal supermarket carts.

211,Female,21,"One of the things that really bother me about the media is the way they objectify and use women. Not only is that morally wrong, but it's sad that women are under constant pressure to be people who they're not. The increase in the number of anorexic girls is remarkable in the past decade, and I believe that the leading cause for that are the unrealistic standards of beauty presented in the media. 

Commercials, TV shows, beauty pageants..etc, are all telling girls to be prettier, skinnier, have straight hair, perfect skin, big eyes, cute little mouth, and the list goes on and on. The makeup industry has been rapidly growing, because women (mainly) seek any product that will help them fit in. 

Not only is it wrong to aspire to look super skinny and use tons of makeup which has many negative effects on the skin and body health in general, but it's also about having a wrong image of role models. Girls should not aspire to look drop-dead-gorgeous with a two digits IQ, beauty is not everything. It's important for the media to focus more on empowering women and encouraging education, volunteering, helping other... rather than making it all about outer beauty. 

Having a thigh gap, visible collar bones and hip bones, or having a straight shiny hair, does not make anyone beautiful. Beauty comes from within; it comes from the heart, from the love of giving, from having a beautiful soul and a happy spirit.

214,Male,28,"I am a 4th year at the Technion Institute of Technology, and I would like to discuss the way the Technion treats students who have difficulty with their studies. I will show one example of many, to make my point.

For instance, a student who goes on MILUIM is entitled to a number of benefits (if he was away for 15 days during one period), when he returns back to school - i will focus on one of them:

25% extra time in exams he is taking for the first time.

Now let's picture the following situation: David is a student at the Technion, and unfortunately for him he failed his exams in Geotechnics. He feels that he failed due to time pressure in the exams since this course is fully loaded with contents.

Now he is retaking the course, and he is called up for Reserves in his IDF unit. David is a good Israeli citizen and he never misses a chance to serve his country, so off he goes. He comes back to school after his Reserves and is granted his benefits as a MILUIM student. 

David cannot enjoy this benefit of 25% extra time, since he is retaking the course! But David obviously needs exactly that kind of help since the exams in Geotechnics are time pressured...

In my point of view - David needs more help than his friend, who has no trouble with his studies, and will take the exams with 25% ET and ace them, easily.

As I said before that is only one example of many more, but it shows the lack of extra thought about the struggling students.

I started studying in the Technion on 2011, but then, after one year of hard work and almost passing all the exams, I decided that I need a change, and decided to pause my studies for 2 semesters and go travelling.

So I bought a flight ticket and flew, by myself, straight to Argentina. I traveled there for 5 weeks and it was an amazing experience! I met so many cultures a long the way and traveled with many different people, I met there people from France, Spain, Argentina and Israel and although I traveled by myself I was actually never alone. 

Argentina was awesome  and it was just the beginning...

Next was Brazil, I said I loved Argentina , but there is no way to compare Brazil to Argentina because Brazil got into my soul, I loved the culture, I loved the people and fell in love with the language - Portuguese.

I started from Rio De junior, I stayed there for 4 days only, it was too crowded for me. then I moved to Jerri, which is a small village in the north of Brazil. I stayed in Jerri for 3 weeks, I learned how to dance Forr'o (a local couple dance), I learned a little Portuguese, and most important, I learned how to surf. Here in Israel I'm living near the beach and since ever I wanted to surf, so trying to surf in Brazil was like a dream come true for me, I never stopped surfing since then, and although I kept traveling and visited many places after Jerri, I will never forget the first time I was on the  board and catching the first wave, I will never forget that feeling and I'm still feeling it every time I'm surfing.

I'm the biggest of my brothers (one boy and two girls).

In school (elementary to high school) I especially enjoyed the math and science  classes, and was pretty good at them, so that I was drafted to the intelligence division when I finished school.

I lived in Kinneret until I was 18 when I joined the army, then I move to an apartment close to the base near Tel-Aviv.

Since then I have continued to try and create more. In middle-school I had a blog, in which I posted random thoughts, stories and Flash animations I made.

I also wrote a couple of more 'serious' musical compositions, although those still lie buried somewhere between the rest of the files in my computer.

Describing over and over again how genius is the main character, talking about his next step and how will the other characters develop.

I opened my eyes to Japanese Anime. a whole new world of talented writers are writing Manga (a Japanese comics), so the Anime is based on the Manga volumes, with a special artificial drawing system that is used in Japan (very different from cartoons).

This time, the plot of tones of series that I watch is amazing, so I am watching Anime for a lot of years, and it renew itself again and again.

They know how to find my old enthusiasm and they keep doing it again and again.

228,Female,25,I would like to tell about a wonderful and unusual day that was during my big trip at Vietnam.  In the north of Vietnam there is a place called Sapa. I think it's the most beautiful place I have ever seen. The only possible way to reach Sapa is by a night train from the capital city. The night train is an experience I will never forget. Residents and tourists both together hurry up for the train with bags in the middle of the night. Lots of scary stories were about this night train. From robbers next to a one snake that got out from his cage and start to go around the train. This trip by the train takes is about 6 hours and you need to try to sleep at the bed in the train. I didn't shut my eyes for one minute because I was shocked from the situation. The train was very old and dusty and slow. After 6 hours when the first light in the morning was shown we arrive to Sapa. The green in Sapa is the most beautiful green and it's seems that we enter to a movie about lonely tribes at the end of the world. In Sapa there are like 12 different tribes when each tribe has its own dress. There are so many colors and smells around you and the tribe's children run for you to say to you welcome and you feel at home at the edge of the world. There are a lot of stories to tell about Sapa but words will never describe this place in a way that someone who didn't visit there will understand. So take a beg and some money and take the train to Sapa.     ,The Left box,Speed!,Door A
229,Male,27,"I want to tell you a little bit about a trip I went to.

I was quite recently released from the army (after being there for about 7 years), I knew I wanted to go to the Technion but first I had to tour the world for a bit, to get some prospective at where I am and what I am doing.



I planned a trip to Mongolia with my brother how was fortunately also released from the army around the same time I was. First, we visited China. We flew to Beijing and spent a few days there. The weather was horrible, very how and foggy and we didn't like it at all over there. The only good part about China was the Great Wall. we went there with a few friends we met at the local inn we stayed at and really liked walking on the wall and looking at the vast green growth that was surrounding it. We even put up a tent and spent a full night on the wall. 



Mongolia was a lot more fun. We rented a van with a few people who were also travelling the country and headed up north. The drive was long and bumpy but every day we got to see an amazing place whether it was natural hot springs, a vast river with a breath-taking view or a volcano which was located on the bank of a lake. When we got to the north-most point, we left the van and went horse-back riding in the snow to meet the people of the Tzaatan who used reindeer as house animals and lived in small wooden tents in the snow. We spent two night there.



The greatest experience of all was right afterwards. We decided to stay at a small village in the north and try to live life as Mongolians. We stayed with a local (non-English speaking) family, ate their food and slept in their home and in return we helped with  their everyday chores such as bringing water from the river, chopping wood and herding their goats and sheep. It was definitely an amazing experience and one I would surly never forget.",The Left box,Speed!,Door A
230,Male,27,"Ever since I was a child, I had an insatiable lust for exploration, expanding my world beyond its limits. At first, the small village I grew up in was this huge and mysterious universe extending beyond the small corner of my neighborhood that our humble house stood at. Soon after, the village felt small and dull, and I would go out into the surrounding fields, always in search of wonders, something new to discover and observe. It was no surprise to my parents that by the time I was seven I insisted on joining the local Sayarut group, and spent the following years climbing up every hill and mountain, walking down into every cave and treading along every stream, brook and river in Israel. By the time I was thirteen I had seen all that our country had to offer, and I wanted to head on, outside of it. But with my parents hailing from modest households, and having three children to raise themselves, and with our neighbors not being as welcome as one would hope them to be, I was bound by Israel's borders. I felt defeated. My lust was not sated, but having no foreseeable way of satisfying it, I ignored it, tucked it away into the corner of my mind. Soon, I stopped hiking altogether, and the termination of my village and neighborhood walks followed not long after. I retreated into the walls of our house, then my room, and started exploring fictional worlds through books instead. That is how I became a fan of science fiction and fantasy literature.

It all started when I got out of elementary school, the group of friends I hung out with was going a direction I did not wish to follow and I found myself entering my middle school years all alone with no group of friends to call mine own.

It wasn't until the 8th-9th grade that I found myself through a few classmates and role-playing games such as Dungeons and Dragons, through them I was also acquainted with the Israeli role playing games online community called Web-Creatures.

The forums of Web-Creatures were a haven, a place where I felt like I could be myself and have fun doing and talking about things I really liked without any judgement. It was this whole experience that led me to be the open and outgoing person I am today and showed me how much fun it was to meet new people and have new experiences, an aspiration I have for my daily life to this day.

It was at this forum, or at least during that time that I came to know the power metal band Blind Guardian, It was over the love of that band that one of my best friends Eddie and I grew close and it's songs to this day accompany me when studying and remind me of a time when I realized anything was possible.

And last weekend, roughly 10 years after that magical teen-age time, I flew to see them in Greece live with Eddie.

The town of Gorkha is where the unification of Nepal began almost three hundred years ago and still instills a sense of pride in every Nepal every time it is mentioned. Today, the only reminder of this is the castle in the hills far above the sprawling modern city. The castle dating back all the way to the first king of Nepal, Prithivi Narayan Shah is a symbolic representation of our unity and sovereignty as a people. 



It is with great sorrow I learnt that in the aftermath of the devastating earthquake two weeks ago, This castle has suffered major  structural damage and surrounding structures are either totally destroyed or in very bad situation. Most of the surrounding villages have been completely destroyed. Many lay dead beneath the ruins. The survivors, few and far between in some places, are in a state of shock and alternate between the recognition of unspeakable horror at the loss of close family and friends and the determination to get better, moving away the ruble and giving the dead a respectable end.

Later on this year I was moved to trombone which was much more fun (it's big and it have low impressive sound). So I took that trombone until the end of the year. 

When I came in the next year they asked me if I wanted to keep on trombone study, so I went back home and consult with my parents, my dad told me to try saxophone so I did.

I was also too small for saxophone, but I had small talent so they kept me, and ever since then I played saxophone, I just fell in love with this sexy, warm an thrilling instrument.

I eventually did my final on music with specialty in saxophone (8 points) and after that I went to the IDF marching band and performed around Israel and also Russia and Hungary with orchestras like Beer Sheva, Kefar Saba and Zichron Yaakov and now I'm studying in the technion material engineering.

So expensive that most Israelis usually do not drink it on a daily, weekly or even monthly basis, but is more of a hangout experience.



In my attempt to figure it out, I decided to brew beer at home. I bought the best ingredients I could find and went through with it . Although I probably was not as efficient as a huge brewery such as Goldstar, I managed to brew 20 liters of beer in approximately 150 Shekels. And the beer was shockingly good. For comparison, a good price for a Goldstar is about 8 shekels for half a liter. Which translates to 320 shekels for 20 liters. That is more than double the price of my homebrew beer. So yes, there are collateral expenses, but this cannot explain the price difference. Basically, as far as I can tell, beer is expensive because we pay the price.

249,Male,24,"Censorship in China



One of the only ways to ensure a totalitarian regime today is a strong and 

definite code restricting individual freedom and rights, such as free speech and the 

right to elect your candidates. In recent publications and addresses the Chinese 

government has censored references to launching political freedom and human rights 

in China made by American officials. Is it justified for the Chinese government to 

censor those remarks, even if they do contradict their interests? Is it acceptable for 

outside factors, such as American speakers and writers, to make such offensive 

declarations in the first place?

Clearly, the Chinese government is interested in keeping things like they are in 

China, and not compromise with any revolutionary ideas that would alter its power. 

So they cross out any reference to what they consider dangerous and provocative: 

human rights, international relations, and political freedom (AKA shift of power in the 

country). But they did not hesitate to pay tribute to progression and strength.

By those criteria, yes, the Chinese government is definitely doing a disservice 

to its people. I do believe these human rights, those ideals by which the Western 

world lives, are indeed crucial. The ability to criticize, change, develop, know, and live 

life fully without being afraid or suppressed - something that seems so natural to most 

of us - is key to peace and sanity. It is the next step in the mental development of the 

human race. Accepting and respecting the individuality, the miscellany, and the 

beauty in each of us and in the whole picture we create.

But needs differ from place to place and from people to people. If the Chinese 

who live under a dictatorial government want a change let them lead their own

censorship can hold back people from thinking and trying to find solutions for their

progression they are the ones doing the harm. I find the American heroic ideology that

Speaking of which, I like words. A friend of mine studies linguistics in the Hebrew University; she and I often discuss ambiguities in meanings of words or similarities between them. Even today, when we were speaking on the phone and I noticed that on the second floor in Ullman building there are old lockers, most of whose numbers are missing, I described the situation of their usage with a word in Hebrew that translates to English as both 'yet' and as 'anymore'. I realized the ambiguity and translated to English in order to clarify. She said that she actually thought I meant the other meaning for a second before realizing herself that I might have meant the first. Sometimes I help her think about examples for the papers she writes.

I have recently read that physicists from the Weizmann Institute who study complex systems have researched a sort of 'basic dictionary' of words that are used to define most other words. In this context, I don't remember why, the Ouroborous was mentioned. My word processor is not familiar with the word. It means the figure of a snake eating its own tail.

I want to tell you about my thoughts while my studies are soon finish.

So, I chose in mechanical engineering degree because this was the most difficult degree I was can registered, not that what I'm interesting.

But now, while I was ""break my tooth"" in my studies and the degree was continued more than 4 years, its upload ideas that maybe I don't want to work in this discipline, and I want to be a teacher and to talk with children and help them to success in their career (how much I can)...

Now , my head is full with thoughts and its just cause to me to finish how much I can my studies at mechanical engineering...these thoughts cause to me a little embarrassment because a degree that took at least five and half years from my life all day are going to garbage. So I am thinking on this a lot of time and check about curriculum to execute this thought.

If I think what the reason this thought up to my mind, is the fact I was teaching pupils that they are in the 11th - 12th class and preparing them to their final exam. I teach them mathematical and they are success and I know that I have an important part in their success. 

They are also gave me after their exam and finish their year in the studies a feedback and gift for their appreciation my investment in their mathematic course, and also told me that they are thinking they would not success and sure not happy to learn mathematics.

256,Female,24,"I feel very strongly that all women should have access to a safe and affordable abortion. Here in Israel there is a problem that the religious communities play a disproportional role in the legislation. 

In Israel, a woman must face a committee and petition the right to an abortion. Officially the only reasons permissible are for physical and psychological health. Most requests for abortion are permitted and even the abortions are then publicly funded. The few women who are denied go to private clinics where, though technically illegal, this practice is tolerated and goes unprosecuted. 

This is seemingly liberal. Everyone in the end is able to receive an abortion. What is the problem? The problem is that Israel should not be behind in women's rights. Israel should be one of the most advanced countries in this. It is not enough to say, 'Well, it is better than in Saudi Arabia'. Let us hold our country to higher standards. 

Having to appeal for a right to an abortion is not only strenuous and a waste of time and resources, it is also demeaning. Maybe the woman does not want to be shamed for her choices. Many people in modern society are afraid of the fact the women sometime enjoy and own their own sexuality. Having a child should not be the punishment for it. In front of the committee she wants to say, 'I had sex, I liked it, there was a mistake in the birth control. No, I won't have physical problems. No, I won't have psychological problems. I am strong. I just don't want a child right now.' 

But she can't say that, she must lie. She must pretend that this would be dangerous for her to continue. This is saying that the woman does not have the choice. She is being 'forced' to have the abortion for health reasons. While this may be true for some women, not all. Why can't abortion be truly a choice for women?",The Right box,Stop!,Door B

Some of anime which became wide-known are ""Pok�mon"", ""Digimon"" and ""Sailor Moon"", and every month, the Japanese anime industry continues to release dozens of new series, some of which are original projects, and some adapted from novels or ""manga"" - Japanese comic books. Sometimes, only the first few chapters of the manga book get adapted into TV-series, which serves as a promotion act meaning to make people who watch the anime and want to know the continuation, start reading the manga book. Anime can come in a variety of TV formats: a TV-series typically 13 or 26 episodes long (though some anime episode count can reach 100+ episodes),nearly 24 minutes long each, an OVA - Original Video Animation - short series of 1 - 2 episodes concluding the story, ""Web"" series with episode's length being 2 - 5 minutes, or a full length animation movie - usually 60 or 90 minutes long.

I have decided to work in pair with my best friend, <PERSONNAME263>. <PERSONNAME263> and I have passion to robots, therefore we have decided to build a robot in our project.

We have set a meeting with the in-charge engineer of the robotic lab at the EE faculty, and asked him if we could come up with original idea for our project. He said that it is possible to do so, and we should update him when we will be ready. After the meeting <PERSONNAME263> and I have begun our search for idea for our project.

Finally, after we had heard his advice, and done a little research, we have chosen to build an autonomously robot that moves throughout a maze and creates a map of the maze.

In the recent days we have started to learn how to control the robot's motors, by commands from the computer. Although the project is in the beginning stage, we have thought about four main steps we are going to perform:

1. Learn how to control the robot's movement, and to be able to pre-program a route in the computer and make the robot follow this route.

2. Fix some sensors on the robot in order to make it be able to ""sense"" it's surrounding

3. Use the data from the sensors in order to be able to ""tell"" the robot how to move and use its ability to move according to computer command in order to have a self-driving robot. 

4. Use clever algorithms that create an map according to the robot's movements and information about its surroundings.

My name <PERSONNAME269> and I would like to tell you about a sport that I like.

It is not very common in Israel, and most people haven't even heard of it -I am talking about professional Frisbee.

Professional Frisbee is being played worldwide, and has a number of different games available; The more common ones are DiskGolf - which is somewhat similar to golf, Ultimate-which is similar to American football, and Freestyle-which is more like a dance with the Frisbee, accompanied by tricks with the Frisbee.

The game of Frisbee is based on honest and respect between players.  One of the more amazing things of Frisbee is that there is no referee during a match! The entire game is based on the players following the rules and not cheating, even if no one saw them.

Even in during championships - no referee is to be found. This makes the sport unique, and educates the players to be fair with themselves and with other players.

No other professional sport is played without a referee.

Playing Frisbee is also very affordable. Most of the game types only require one disk, so an entire group only needs to spend about 30$

Given all of these benefits, it's hard to say why we're not playing Frisbee all over Israel.

I have never seen such an amazing view; I just stopped and stared for about an hour. Just sitting on the shore, zipping some drinks and watching the water. Relaxation at its best. AS I said, I went on this trip for about 2 months and then returned to Israel. Returning was not easy at all; people in Israel did not understand me. I just wanted to return to Mexico. I plan on going to Mexico again after graduation and visit all the amazing views I visited, and of course visit Julio.",The Right box,Stop!,Door C
274,Male,26,"I want to tell you about a thing that I had seen before a couple of years, when I was very little and didn't know a lot of things I know today. In one day I went afternoon to travel down from the house and look for unique kinds of animals, birds that are flying on the air, many kinds of flowers that smell beautiful and trees that have fresh fruits on them, waiting just to be collecting down from the trees and Into people mouse. when I went down I saw immediately that something is not the same, something looked bad and misteriously. in the air was a silence. any bird had made a voice. everything waited for something that needs to come. and in a moment there was a big crash and the area was  broken into two pieces from the middle and  started to swallow all the things that were in the way of the break. I started to run the fast that I can, up the hill and screamed and shouted till someone will hear me and will tray to escape also from the break before it will catch and swallow him also. I saw an old man that heard me but he cant run so he had just looked amazing until he had swallowed in.  I saw another farmer man that took his legs and ran the fast that he can up the hill but he was caught also. when I came almost to my house the big break caught me also and I fell down into the ground, down and down until I found myself in the other side of the earth, on an island near Tasmania.

275,Female,21,"I am a girl, but that doesn't mean I must behave like society expects a girl to behave. Society dictates what the right behavior is for a boy and what the right behavior is for a girl. Boys must be tough, and girl must be emotional. Boys must like sports, and girls must care about their looks.

Boys are expected to study engineering, while girls study education and psychology. The list is endless, and it is infuriating.

I wish one day a child will be able to grow up and become the person they want to become. Why should girls play with dolls and boys with trucks? There is no rational behind all of this, each person should be their own individual. 

I think so much of what makes us who we are is how society treats us. Since girls are little they are used to people treating them gently and feeling sorry for them when they cry. This makes girls feel that showing emotion and weakness is a good thing that helps them. On the other hand, boys are scowled at when they cry, and therefore boys grow up thinking that showing emotion is a sign of weakness. I feel very strongly about this topic, and hope that one day this will not be relevant.",The Right box,Speed!,Door B
276,Male,24,"I am going to tell you about my long trip to America.

It started about a month after I finished my military service, when I got on a plane to the US, in order to participate as a counsellor in a Jewish summer camp.

After two months at camp, I was off to NYC for a week, where I stayed at my cousin's apartment and mostly shopped for the next part of my trip, South America.

I landed in Lima, capital of Peru, and started my trip. The first destination was Huaraz, where I went on an eight-day-trek by the name of Huayhuash. The trek was incredibly beautiful.

The next destination was Huacachina, where I went for sand skiing, which was pretty awesome.

Next city was Cuzco, which is a crazy touristic city with great views all around it. The major attraction was the Macchu Picchu, which is one of the men-made seven wonders.

I was in Cuzco for almost three weeks and went off to La Paz, capital of Bolivia.

In La Paz I went on a few different treks, the most exciting of them was to a major Glacier, where we got to the height of 5600 meters.

Next stop was Rurrenabaque, a town in the middle of infinite jungles. I went on a few days trip into those jungles, got eaten by some mosquitoes and ate some jungle fruits.

Last stop in Bolivia was Uyuni, a god forsaken town where the only good thing to do is to go on a trip into the Salar, a salt desert.

I think that's enough for now.

277,Male,19,"This is a story about how I got accepted into the Johannes Rau Grant delegation. During the spring of tenth grade, our school counselor came into our class to tell us about a delegation by the German embassy for teen Israelis to go to Germany for free and stay at fellow German teens' homes and to visit Berlin for tours and group discussions. I decided to try to get accepted into the program.

According to the sheet the counselor handed out, there were two parts to getting accepted. The first was answering some factual questions (like naming two famous German sportsmen and naming all the districts in Germany) along with writing a one-page opinionated essay about Law of Return. A few weeks after I sent that in, I got a reply that I was among the fifty to pass the first part, and I was invited for an interview in the German Embassy which was the second part. There I sat with four other teens for a group interview about what we do and why we think we should be chosen.

Finally, a few months after my interview, and many weeks after I had long given up hope, I received a call saying that I was one of the 20 finalists, meaning that during Sukkot of the following year I'll fly to Germany. This was one of the happiest moments of my life. During the delegation I met some of my best friends and got to see Berlin which had always been a dream of mine.",The Left box,Stop!,Door C
278,Male,26,"A few years ago I sailed to Greece with 10 of my friends, it was a trip with our youth movement. There was a skipper and shift manager on board but we were the crew, holding the wheel, writing the log (containing mainly weather conditions), drawing our route on the map and setting the course. Looking out and cleaning were also our responsibility.

We heard a lot about this trip from our older friends, and knew it is an experience of a life time. That's why we were a bit disappointed after two days on board when we realized we are mainly throwing up and working.... Nothing exciting was happening.

As the sea sickness was losing its grip on us, We got to a small island called ""(No Suggestions)"" containing three mountains and one street engulfing the marina, we tracked up the mountains there, and enjoyed the beautiful light blue clean water of the Aegean, enjoying the fact it is now ours and not us his, we continued sailing between the islands for a week 

On our way back to Israel, on our way back we already understood what's so special about this trip, as the sun was setting behind us and the moon rising in front of us, and everything in between were the sea and the skies, we knew we became closer to nature, that let us know one more secret about herself, and let us taste the rhythm of the Mediterranean.",The Right box,Stop!,Door B
279,Male,20,"I want to tell about a passion I have - travel the world.

I always wanted to travel and see the world, not just the touristic places like Paris or London but the exotic, without a lot of tourists, like Malaysia, Burma, South Americas, Africa etc. the hidden beaches and lakes, little pieces of heaven hidden from sight.

For a while now whenever I stumble upon an article, or just a random post on the internet that talks about, or shows, exotic, unique or interesting  places you can visit I save those places (with the source) in a document sorted by the continent (North America, Europe, S.E Asia and so on). I still haven't finished sorting all the articles I found but once I will I plan on marking all the locations on the map and plan a route between them (after I read about each location) - if there are interesting places between two locations I will plan the route to include them, otherwise the route will be the shortest. I want to build the trip in ""phases"" - like blocks, in a way I could continue the trip in case I have to go back home (if I finish ""a block"" I can choose to go back home or go on with the trip).

In order to save money I wish to start each block from the cheapest country to get to and then travel from country to country in the cheapest way possible (say train, bus, donkey etc.).

I want to start the trip after I finished with my degree and save enough money for at least two ""blocks"" (save up money and start a new adventure).",The Left box,Speed!,Door B
280,Female,22,"I am vegan. I wasn't always vegan, nor any of my family is vegan. 

For me, becoming vegan was a quest of self-empowering, and I'd like to tell my story.

It all started when I was 14, with one acquaintance I had. She was older than me in 3 years, and she was vegan. Back then, I didn't even know what vegan means.

She was patient, and explained everything to me. As any girl would have been in my place, I was shocked. That was the first time I decided I WANT to be vegan. But vegan was so hard, I couldn't just stop eating everything I've always known as food. So I became vegetarian.

But that didn't last for too long, after 6 month I stopped believing I can make a change and went back to eat meat. Deep down, I knew I'm not right. And so, when I was 16 I started thinking about the subject with more mature eyes. I started to think about life, about it's meanings and about our rights as humans. Again I started to be vegetarian, but now from the place of knowing it's not my decision to make - to take another being's life.

And so, from that moment I realized this very huge thing, I couldn't think about eating meat any more. When not given a choice, it's just so easier!",The Left box,Stop!,Door B
281,Female,20,"My name is <PERSONNAME281>, I live in a village called Daliat El Carmel, in Israel. I'm the youngest member of my family, my name is in Arabic and it refers to a kind of bird - the Curlew, I speak 3 language: Arabic, Hebrew and English, started to learn Germany but didn't continue. 

I read a lot in English and run a blog, some idea I would like to share is a phenomenon that isn't much known called lucid dreams. The definition of it is being able to know that you're dreaming in the dream itself, and sometimes being able to change events or thing in the dream the way you want to. It's amazing how the human brain can do such thing, and I wonder if any kind of animal has the ability to do so.

I had few lucid dreams, some were without being aware of the phenomenon, and some after it, and after I followed some steps of how to get me dream of one.

One step is to always try to remember your dream, and even to write it, it's important to do it regularly. 

Another thing is a reality check, you always have to do a reality check, take few moments and convince yourself from the inside that you might be dreaming and need to do a check to see if you really are dreaming or not, this action, if done right, will appear in your dream, and you could be aware while dreaming that you are actually sleeping and can change whatever you'd like in the dream.

I have a friend who did that for a while, and succeeded to have many dreams like this, he had the chance to do many stuff he had wanted, like flying.

I found this quite interesting and worth trying, I hope you enjoyed this information, and good luck if you try it!",The Right box,Speed!,Door C
